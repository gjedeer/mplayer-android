VIDIX - Video Interface for *niX.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This library was designed and introduced as interface to userspace drivers
to provide DGA everywhere where it's possible (unline X11).
I hope that these drivers will be portable same as X11 (not only on *nix).

For details on how to develop a new driver see trunk/DOCS/tech/vidix.txt

IMPORTANT: These are NOT linux kernel drivers. If you are looking for
the mga_vid linux kernel drivers, please cd ../drivers thanks.
