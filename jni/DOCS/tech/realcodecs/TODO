TODO:

- more docs are coming as I find the time to write them down
- use RV20toYUV420Free()
- audio support - nearly DONE (look below)
- internet streaming support
- searching - we need to take care of the audio interleaving -
  haven't taken steps to locate audio key frames (does such thing
  exist?)
- some media files can't be played (mplayer crashes/fails) because
  it asks for decoded audio data, but the buffer in the audio
  demuxer packets are empty/missing. It seems that the necessary
  audio packets haven't been decoded completely (incomplete interleaving)
  the audio stream packets may get mixed with video stream packet - DONE ???
- put variables for audio streaming inside real_priv_t
- audio support for other formats than COOK - use a switch
  (like -forcereal) to activate it - no switch needed, win32 codecs
  doens't work (it was a nonworking attempt)
- postprocessing support (see rp8 preferences->performance->cpu usage,
  also statistics->streams->video->POST FILTER: ON
  (i've found that custommessage calls differ wiht pp on/off, but adding
  these calls to mplayer didn't make a pixel difference between outputs)
