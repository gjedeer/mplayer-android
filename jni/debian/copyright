--- TOOLS

In the TOOLS directory you can find some nice scripts and code that
makes using MPlayer and MEncoder easier, for example scripts for DVD
track encoding in three pass mode or creating SVCDs from a movie.

MPlayer scripts in the TOOLS dir
--------------------------------

              LAME, tooLAME and SoX.


dvd2divxscript.pl

Author:       Florian Schilhabel

Description:  Yet another DVD to divx helper script.
              This script encodes a DVD track in three pass mode to MPEG-4 with
              libavcodec. Optionally it writes the resulting movie file to
              CD-ROM the corresponding audio track to MP3. It can also shut
              down the computer when it finishes. If you like, you can
              watch the MEncoder output on /dev/tty8.

Usage:        --help       show help
              --abr        (AudioBitRate) Please enter the desired bitrate this
                           can be either [96|128|192] kbit/sec (default: 128).
              --lang       Specify the Language of the audio track this can be
                           for example <en> or <de> (default: <de>).
              --dvd        Specify the DVD track you want to encode.
              --cdsize     Specify the size of your CD-ROM (default: 700MB).
              --shutdown   Shutdown the system, when the encoding process has
                           finished. Needs appropriate privileges.
              --out        Specify the name of your encoded movie. The file
                           extension will be appended automatically.
              --writecd    Takes the newly created movie and writes it to a
                           CD-ROM.
              --writedev   cdrecord device identifier, for example 0,1,0
              --speed      writing speed (default: 4)
              --dvd-device device to pull the video off (default: /dev/dvd)


aconvert.sh

Author:       Jonas Jermann

Description:  A hack to allow MEncoder to read respectively encode from audio
              only files.

Usage:        aconvert.sh <"input file"> <"output file"> <"options">
              If no options are specified the following is assumed:
              -oac lavc -lavcopts acodec=mp3:abitrate=192

Note:         The script is probably bash dependent and it's just a quick
              hack, feel free to improve it (or much better: fix MEncoder ;).



qepdvcd.sh

Author:       Reynaldo H. Verdejo Pinochet

Description:  converter from any supported format to VCD/SVCD PAL/NTSC

Usage:        qepdvcd.sh file <options>
              Run with no arguments to see the list of options.

Note:         You will need vcdimager/cdrecord to master/burn the resulting
              files.



Tech scripts in the TOOLS dir
-----------------------------

calcbpp.pl

Author:       Moritz Bunkus

Description:  A script that calculates the $bpp for a movie, mentioned in
              DOCS/tech/encoding-tips.txt, see that document for more info.

Usage:        calcbpp.pl <resolution> <aspect ratio> <bitrate> <fps>
              resolution:    the cropped but unscaled resolution
                             (use '-vf cropdetect')
              aspect ratio:  the encoded aspect ratio. All DVDs come at
                             720x576 but contain a flag that tells the player
                             wether it should display the DVD at an aspect
                             ratio of 4/3 (1.333) or at 16/9 (1.777). Have a
                             look at MPlayer's output - there's something
                             about 'prescaling'. That's what you are looking
                             for.
              bitrate:       the video bitrate in kbit/s
              fps:           the fps

              example: calcbpp.pl 720x440 16/9 896 25


countquant.pl

Author:       Moritz Bunkus

Description:  Counts the quantizers used for the encoding, mentioned in
              DOCS/tech/encoding-tips.txt, see that document for more info.

Usage:        countquant.pl < divx2pass.log
              It will print out which quantizer was used how often. If you see
              that e.g. the lowest quantizer (vqmin=2) gets used for > 95% of
              the frames then you can safely increase your picture size.


plotpsnr.pl

Author:       Jonas Jermann

Description:  Draw PSNR log graphs using gnuplot.

Usage:        plotpsnr.pl [options] <file>
              -h, --help    Display this help message
              -quant        Display quantizers
              -size         Display size
              -psnr         Display PSNR
              -iframes      Display I-frames
              -pframes      Display P-frames
              -bframes      Display B-frames
              -aframes      Display all frames in different colors
              -cmp <file2>  Compare two files
              -qs <style>   Quantizer style
              -ss <style>   Size style
              -ps <style>   PSNR style

              Default: -quant -size -psnr -qs "p" -ss "i" -ps "p"

Note:         Requires gnuplot. Comparison is based on file2. Comparison
              assumes that the frame numbers of both files fit.


psnr-video.sh

Author:       Matthias Wieser

Description:  Calculates the PSNR between two existing video files.
              The PSNR is calculated frame by frame.
              Also prints the overall PSNR.
              The script can be used to:
               * Compare different softwarescalers (should I use
                 -sws 1 or -sws 2 ?)
               * Compare different resolutions (is it better to scale
                 down to 640x360 or to 560x320)
               * Compare different deinterlacers
               * Compare different video codecs
               * Compare video filters (is it better to use -vf hqdn3d
                 or lavcopts:nr=400)
               * [...]

Usage:        psnr-video.sh <file1> <file2> [<frames>] [<options1>] [<options2>]

              <file1> and <file2> are the video files for which the PSNR
                should be calculated.
              [<frames>] is the number of frames to process, starting
                from frame 1.
              [<options1>] are additional MPlayer options for <file1>
              [<options2>] are additional MPlayer options for <file2>

              A file called ./psnr.dat will be created with the following
              content:

netstream - access remote streams
---------------------------------

NOTE: netstream does not link at the moment - help welcome.

netstream allows you to access most MPlayer stream types from a remote host.
The main purpose of this feature is to make it possible to directly use the
CD or DVD drive of another computer on the network (provided you have the
required bandwidth). On the downside some stream types (currently TV and MF)
are not usable remotely because they are implemented at the demuxer level.

Be aware that currently the server is not secure at all.

Compile the server by running 'make netstream' and then copy the netstream
binary to the right place on your system (usually /usr/local/bin on Unix).
Start the netstream server on the computer you intend to access remotely.
There are no command line arguments.

Play the second track of a VCD on the server with:

  mplayer -cache 5000 mpst://servername/vcd://2

Access files on this server with:

  mplayer -cache 5000 mpst://servername//usr/local/movies/lol.avi

Note that paths which do not start with a / will be interpreted as relative to
the directory where the server is running. The '-cache' option is not needed
but highly recommended.
