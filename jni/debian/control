Description: movie player for Unix-like systems
 MPlayer plays most MPEG, VOB, AVI, Ogg/OGM, VIVO,
 ASF/WMA/WMV, QT/MOV/MP4, FLI, RM, NuppelVideo, yuv4mpeg, FILM, RoQ, PVA files,
 supported by many native, XAnim, RealPlayer, and Win32 DLL codecs. It can
 also play VideoCD, SVCD, DVD, 3ivx, RealMedia, and DivX movies.
 .
 Another big feature of MPlayer is the wide range of supported output
 drivers. It works with X11, Xv, DGA, OpenGL, SVGAlib, fbdev,
 DirectFB, but also SDL (plus all its drivers) and some
 low level card-specific drivers (for Matrox, 3Dfx and Radeon, Mach64
 and Permedia3). Most of them support software or hardware scaling,
 therefore allowing fullscreen display.  MPlayer is also able
 to use some hardware MPEG decoder boards, such as the DVB
 and DXR3/Hollywood+.
 .
 This package includes the gui variant of mplayer.
